### The End of Pas Tar
Pas Tar was the strongest sorcerer in Egypt.  And he had a crush on the Pharaoh's daughter, but even though he was strong and rich and powerful and kind the Pharaoh would not let them marry. The Pharaoh was very jealous and worried about how strong Pas Tar would be if they married and had a child.

One day the Pharaoh's workers where trying to save a pyramid that was sinking into the sand.  Pas Tar used magic to lift the pyramid 500 ft in the air and place it back down in a more stable spot.  Instead of being thankful, the Pharaoh was super mad.  So mad he had his torturer remove Pas Tar's left pointer finger.  This made it hard for Pas Tar to use magic.  The Pharaoh took advantage of this to banish Pas Tar to the desert.

Pas Tar wandered into the desert for two weeks.  No one knew what happened to him so they sent a search party to make sure he was dead.  His cousin and his cousin's wife went along with the search party.  To follow him, the tracked his footprints and the little bits of magic dust that he dropped.

Even though he was gone for two weeks, they found him in a day.  Pas Tar had stopped.  The search party approached him, called to him, but he didn't move or answer.  When they finally reached him and tapped his shoulder, he fell over dead.  His entire body had dried out.  He was just skin stretched over bones.

When they touch him, the skin fell off and he was just a skeleton.

### The Rebirth of Pas Tar
After he touched the skin, the Greek slave Octavion stopped dead in his tracks.  The tremors started slowly, but pretty soon he was shaking like the trees when a herd of hippos pass by.  Then he arched his back, stuck his hands out and blasted lazers out of his eyes.  The soul of Pas Tar had passed from the dusty skeleton to Octavion who was now not only as powerful as Pas Tar was, but also possessed the dark magic of the dead.
